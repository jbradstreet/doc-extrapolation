# Documentation Extrapolation

While navigating through blogs, stack overflow posts, and official documentation, I found that a lot of these sites will list steps from A - Z without mentioning every step along the way. Not only is this frustrating, but also time consuming as you end up spending hours researching those missing steps. 

Sure, submitting comments to clarify will help, but we all need to SEE the process - are you in the root directory to execute that command, what order are you executing those dependenies, etc.? 

My app offers a simple format for showing how developers overcome terrible documentation. Take screenshots of what you did, and accompany those screenshots with captions detailing your steps. Your posts are saved online and other people can see what you did and benefit from your input! 

## Upcoming Features
* Tags for your posts - categorize your posts and make it easier to search for them.
* "Likes" or badges - motivation to contribute to the community with your help.
